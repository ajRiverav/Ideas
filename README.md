# Ideas
This is just a way to keep track of ideas (hacks, etc...) 

* Analyze Aircraft crashes using NTSB Database

Possible Qs to answer: Aircraft age, flight phase, Damage Category, Location, Location normalized. 

* MacBook Air's trackpad sensitivity transfer function

This would involve measuring the response of the trackpad to different user inputs (speed, especially). In the end, one would know the transfer function of the trackpad (transfer function means how the device maps user inputs to the pointer on the screen).

* Intercom hack

Intercoms, upon choosing a unit number, call the unit's phone number which sometimes can be heard on the speaker. If one records that sound, the number can be reverse-engineered using an FFTs vs. time plot (spectrogram).
